Certainly! I'll break down the custom rule Python code you've provided into a step-by-step flow, suitable for creating a flowchart:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A JSON structure (`json_list_RuleID_2113`) is defined. This structure appears to define a query, with filters and other configurations, to fetch specific data from a source. 

2. **Function: `calculate_custom_scope`**:
   - As its name suggests, this function would be used to calculate a custom scope. Currently, it's a placeholder and just returns `None`.

3. **Function: `dq_engine_custom`**:
   - This is the main custom rule function that gets executed when the `dq_engine` encounters a custom rule.

   3.1 **Extracting Rule Details**:
      - The function extracts details like `rule_id` and `ingestion_cd` from the `rule_details` argument.

   3.2 **Data Fetching**:
      - The function uses the `get_rule_query_response_data` method to fetch data based on the query defined in `json_list_RuleID_2113`.

   3.3 **Data Processing**:
      - If the fetched data (`df_2113`) is a DataFrame:
         - Filter the data to create two DataFrames:
            - `query_response_2113_1`: Contains records with null `dnsName` values.
            - `query_response_2113_2`: Contains records with non-null `dnsName` values that match a specific pattern.
         - Merge `df_2113` with `query_response_2113_2` to identify records that are present in `df_2113` but not in `query_response_2113_2`.
         - Extract the exception records (`response_2113_excpn`) and drop duplicates based on a unique ID (`OSI:invNo`).
         - Rename columns to ensure consistency with expected output format.

   3.4 **Handling Non-DataFrame Responses**:
      - If the fetched data (`df_2113`) is not a DataFrame but a response object, an error message is printed and an exception is raised.

   3.5 **Custom Scope Calculation**:
      - Attempts to calculate the custom scope using the `calculate_custom_scope` function. If there's an error in this step, it prints an error message and sets `scope_count` to `None`.

   3.6 **Error Handling**:
      - Any exceptions encountered during data processing or custom scope calculation are caught and printed.

   3.7 **Returning Data**:
      - The function returns two values:
         - `df_excp_rcd_final`: A DataFrame containing the exception records.
         - `scope_count`: The calculated scope count.

The above sequence provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the custom rule code. This should provide a good foundation for creating a flowchart to represent the logic of this custom rule.
